    TODO: After lots of unexpected roadblocks, I'm abandoning this idea for now. The number of 8-bit representations 
          necessary turns out to be 260, just over 256. It's because moves on the long diagonal must be assigned an
          8-bit binary prefix, but then do not make full use of the subsequent 3 bits, since they only have 4 moves
          in their symmetry group instead of 8. This means we run out of 8-bit prefixes too early, counterintuitively.
          Here's the math:
          
            - There are 1924 actions total (see my chess-action-space repo)
            - Moves on either long diagonal have only 4 moves in their symmetry group - there are 
              8 * 7 * 2 = 112 of those. We need 112 / 4 = 28 8-bit base numbers to represent them.
            - The underpromotion action space is (8 + 7 + 7) moves * 2 sides * 3 pieces = 132, but by checking the
              turn while encoding/decoding, we can effectively reduce it by half to 66. It would be nice to assign
              each underpromotion's (from_sq, to_sq) pair an 8-bit base so we can easily distinguish them from 
              non-underpromotions, including regular moves and the "default" queen promotion, since then we
              could use the next 2 bits to specify the underpromotion piece. This means we should conceptualize
              underpromotion moves as having no symmetries: each movement is unique. So we need to consume 
              (8 + 7 + 7) = 22 more 8-bit bases here. The total is now 28 + 22 = 50.
            - All other moves of the 1924 have 8 moves in their symmetry group. There are 1924 - 112 - 132 = 1680
              of them, so we need 1680 / 8 = 210 8-bit bases to represent them. The final total is 260, just over 
              2 ** 8 = 256.
              
          To fix, we would have to be smart about which moves consume 9 bits. While encoding and decoding, we would
          have to know based on only the first 8 bits whether that base is one that requires 9 bits to distinguish.
          We cannot just continue assigning the binary representation of a gensym-ed number once it hits 9 bits long
          because the first 8 of those bits will already have been generated and assigned to some other move.
          
          We should probably choose 4 relatively uncommon base moves (from 4 different symmetry groups) whose 8-bit 
          prefixes make up a special case, where a 9th bit is read to distinguish the base move. Then the same scheme 
          applies where the next 3 bits determine the symmetries to be applied to the base move.
          
          Another option, which seems inherently worse, is to use another bit to represent moves where the 
          (from_sq, to_sq) pair is the same as that of an underpromotion move for the side to move. If the bit is 
          a 0, we can say the move is a non-underpromotion; if it's a 1, it's an underpromotion and the next 2 bits 
          should determine the piece. I don't think this will offer maximal compression since it requires an extra bit
          each time a piece is moved from the 7th to the 8th rank (except for knights) from the POV of the side to move
          (not that uncommon, especially in endgames).
          
          A hacky option is to not care about ex. capturing underpromotions onto a corner squares, which would 
          free 4 of the 260 8-bit bases. This means [b7a8, b2a1, g7h8, g2h1]=[R, B, N] would encode to 
          [b7a8, b2a1, g7h8, g2h1]=Q. We surely wouldn't miss many moves, but the ones we do might be brilliant.
